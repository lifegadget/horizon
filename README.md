# Horizon Container
> leverage the beauty and simplicity of [Horizon](http://horizon.io) within the beauty and simplicity of [Docker](http://docker.com)

## Labelling Strategy
The following labels will always be available:

- `latest` - the latest version of horizon available on npm
- _Specific versions_ (aka, `1.1.3` for that Horizon version)
- `dev` - the latest version of horizon on npm but with development settings all set appropriately for dev
